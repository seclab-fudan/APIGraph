{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "java.nio.file.attribute.UserPrincipal", "ClassDesc": "A Principal representing an identity used to determine access rights to objects in a file system. On many platforms and file systems an entity requires appropriate access rights or permissions in order to access objects in a file system. The access rights are generally performed by checking the identity of the entity. For example, on implementations that use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enforce privilege separation then a file in the file system may have an associated ACL that determines the access rights of identities specified in the ACL. A UserPrincipal object is an abstract representation of an identity. It has a @B_java#security#Principal#getName_E@ that is typically the username or account name that it represents. User principal objects may be obtained using a @B_java#nio#file#attribute#UserPrincipalLookupService_E@, or returned by @B_java#nio#file#attribute#FileAttributeView_E@ implementations that provide access to identity related attributes. For example, the @B_java#nio#file#attribute#AclFileAttributeView_E@ and @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFileAttributeView_E@ provide access to a file's @B_java#nio#file#attribute#PosixFileAttributes#owner_E@."}
