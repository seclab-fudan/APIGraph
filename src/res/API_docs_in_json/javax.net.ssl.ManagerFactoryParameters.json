{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "javax.net.ssl.ManagerFactoryParameters", "ClassDesc": "This class is the base interface for providing algorithm-specific information to a KeyManagerFactory or TrustManagerFactory. In some cases, initialization parameters other than keystores may be needed by a provider. Users of that particular provider are expected to pass an implementation of the appropriate sub-interface of this class as defined by the provider. The provider can then call the specified methods in the ManagerFactoryParameters implementation to obtain the needed information."}
