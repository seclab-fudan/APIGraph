{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "android.support.test.filters.LargeTest", "ClassDesc": "Annotation to assign a large test size qualifier to a test. This annotation can be used at a method or class level. Test size qualifiers are a great way to structure test code and are used to assign a test to a test suite of similar run time. Execution time: >1000ms Large tests should be focused on testing integration of all application components. These tests fully participate in the system and may make use of all resources such as databases, file systems and network. As a rule of thumb most functional UI tests are large tests. Note: This class replaces the deprecated Android platform size qualifier"}
