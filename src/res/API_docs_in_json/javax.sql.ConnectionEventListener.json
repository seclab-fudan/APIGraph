The ConnectionEventListener interface is implemented by a connection pooling component. A connection pooling component will usually be provided by a JDBC driver vendor or another system software vendor. A JDBC driver notifies a ConnectionEventListener object when an application is finished using a pooled connection with which the listener has registered. The notification occurs after the application calls the method close on its representation of a PooledConnection object. A ConnectionEventListener is also notified when a connection error occurs due to the fact that the PooledConnection is unfit for future use---the server has crashed, for example. The listener is notified by the JDBC driver just before the driver throws an SQLException to the application using the PooledConnection object."}
