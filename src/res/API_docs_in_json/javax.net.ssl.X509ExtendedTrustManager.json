To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, hostname checks can be done to verify that the hostname in an end-entity certificate matches the targeted hostname. TLS does not require such checks, but some protocols over TLS (such as HTTPS) do. In earlier versions of the JDK, the certificate chain checks were done at the SSL/TLS layer, and the hostname verification checks were done at the layer over TLS. This class allows for the checking to be done during a single call to this class. RFC 2830 defines the server identification specification for the \"LDAPS\" algorithm. RFC 2818 defines both the server identification and the client identification specification for the \"HTTPS\" algorithm."}
