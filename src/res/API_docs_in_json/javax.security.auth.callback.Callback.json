{"Functions": {}, "Inheritance": [], "ClassName": "javax.security.auth.callback.Callback", "ClassDesc": "Implementations of this interface are passed to a CallbackHandler, allowing underlying security services the ability to interact with a calling application to retrieve specific authentication data such as usernames and passwords, or to display certain information, such as error and warning messages. Callback implementations do not retrieve or display the information requested by underlying security services. Callback implementations simply provide the means to pass such requests to applications, and for applications, if appropriate, to return requested information back to the underlying security services."}
